## Summary

A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presented with sharp chest pain localized over the heart area, lasting a few seconds and worsening with coughing or lying down. The pain began three days ago, occurs intermittently, and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes feels it radiate to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu but has no history of medical conditions, surgeries, or medication use aside from occasional Tylenol. Notably, his father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient significant anxiety about his own symptoms. He does not smoke or use recreational drugs and drinks alcohol occasionally. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart function. The patient is reassured to avoid excessive worry while awaiting diagnostic results.
