## Summary

**Main Topic/Purpose:**  
A 25-year-old patient presents with sharp chest pain, concerned about a possible heart attack due to recent family history.

**Key Points:**  
• Patient reports sharp, intermittent chest pain over three days, worsened by coughing and lying down, relieved by leaning forward.  
• No associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though had flu last week.  
• No significant past medical history, no medications except occasional Tylenol, no smoking or drug use.  
• Family history significant for father’s recent fatal heart attack two weeks ago.  
• Patient is a healthy engineering student working part-time as a postman, living with mother.

**Details & Context:**  
The chest pain is localized over the heart area, rated 6/10 in intensity, sometimes radiating to the neck. It lasts a few seconds and is not constant. The patient denies other cardiac or systemic symptoms. The recent flu may be relevant, but no current infection signs are present. The family history raises concern for cardiac issues. The patient’s lifestyle and medical background do not suggest typical cardiac risk factors.

**Conclusions/Outcomes:**  
The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate cardiac function and rule out serious conditions. The patient is advised not to worry excessively while awaiting test results. Further management will depend on diagnostic findings.
