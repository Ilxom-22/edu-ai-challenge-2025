## Summary

**Main Topic/Purpose:**  
Assessment of a 25-year-old patient presenting with sharp chest pain and concerns about a possible heart attack following recent family bereavement.

**Key Points:**  
• Patient reports sharp, intermittent chest pain localized over the heart, lasting seconds, worsened by coughing and lying down, relieved by leaning forward.  
• No associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or systemic signs; recent recovery from flu noted.  
• Family history significant for father’s fatal heart attack two weeks prior; patient is otherwise healthy with no chronic conditions or medication use aside from occasional Tylenol.

**Details & Context:**  
The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, experiences chest pain for three days without prior episodes. Pain intensity rates 6/10, sometimes radiating to the neck. No history of trauma, drug use, smoking, or significant alcohol intake. The recent flu and emotional stress from the father’s death contribute to anxiety about cardiac events. Physical examination and history suggest non-cardiac chest pain, but cardiac evaluation is warranted due to family history and symptomatology.

**Conclusions/Outcomes:**  
Plan includes performing an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate cardiac function and rule out acute coronary syndrome. Patient advised to avoid excessive worry pending test results. Further management will be guided by diagnostic findings.
