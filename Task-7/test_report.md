## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Any recent version (v12+ recommended)
- **No additional dependencies**: Tests use built-in Node.js modules only

### Running the Test Suite

#### Basic Test Execution
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Task-7

# Run all tests
node test.js
```

#### Expected Output
```
🧪 Running Sea Battle Game Unit Tests

✅ Ship: Constructor should initialize locations and hits
✅ Ship: hit() should mark location as hit and return true for valid hit
