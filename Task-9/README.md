   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your OpenAI API key**
   
   **Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   
   # On Windows (Command Prompt)
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   
   **Option B: Command Line Parameter**
   ```bash

   ```

## üí° Usage

The application supports two main modes of operation:

### Mode 1: Analyze Known Services

Analyze well-known digital services by name:

```bash
python main.py --service "Spotify"
python main.py --service "Notion"
python main.py --service "Netflix"
python main.py -s "GitHub"
```

### Mode 2: Analyze Custom Service Descriptions

Provide your own service description text:

```bash
python main.py --text "A cloud-based project management tool that helps teams collaborate, track tasks, and manage deadlines with real-time updates and integrations."
```

```bash
python main.py -t "An AI-powered language learning app that uses personalized lessons, gamification, and speech recognition to help users learn new languages effectively."
```

### Save Reports to Files

Add the `--output` parameter to save reports to markdown files:

```bash
python main.py --service "Spotify" --output spotify_analysis.md
python main.py --text "Your service description here" --output custom_analysis.md
```

## üîß Command Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Required |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `--service` | `-s` | Name of a known service to analyze | Yes* |
| `--text` | `-t` | Raw service description text to analyze | Yes* |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output file to save the report | No |
| `--api-key` | | OpenAI API key (if not set as env variable) | No** |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message and exit | No |

*Either `--service` or `--text` is required (mutually exclusive)
**Required if OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set

## üìñ Example Commands

```bash
# Basic service analysis
python main.py --service "Discord"

# Analyze with custom description
python main.py --text "A subscription-based streaming service offering unlimited access to movies, TV shows, and original content across multiple devices."
