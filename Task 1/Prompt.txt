You are an expert in software architecture and database design.

I am building a new application and need your help selecting the most suitable type of database. Apply *Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning* to evaluate the requirements and walk through the decision-making process step-by-step. Do not jump directly to the answer. Instead, analyze each requirement, explain how it impacts the choice, and use that reasoning to arrive at a justified decision.

Here are the project requirements:
- It's a social platform expected to have millions of users.
- It needs to store user profiles, posts, and social connections (e.g., followers, friends).
- High data read speed is important.
- The read/write ratio is expected to be 80% reads and 20% writes.
- Scalability is a key factor due to expected user growth.

Your task is to:
1. Break down and analyze each requirement.
2. Compare suitable database types (e.g., relational, NoSQL document, graph databases).
3. Justify your final database recommendation based on the analysis.
4. Make the reasoning transparent, structured, and easy to follow using step-by-step logic.

Conclude with the best-suited database type for this use case and explain why.
